    <main>

            <h2>The Blow Hole</h2>
            <p>One the first day in Maui we went to what is described as &quot;The Blow Hole&quot;. It was a hole in a
                rock by the ocean, that when waves wash up into it, it blows water through
                the hole that is in the rock. Learn more about the <a

            <h2>Food</h2>
            <p>The Food in Maui, was delicious. It was familiar to food we eat on the &quot;Main Land&quot;, but had
                certain differences. Our favorite food on maui that we did not expect to
                like was the spam fried Rice. Another local favorite is Loco Moco.
